    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This spicy vodka pasta is a nice change from your typical tomato sauce. 
        If you're worried about the alcohol, don't be! It cooks off and cannot be tasted. It simply helps to enhance the flavors.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked penne pasta</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 (3.5 ounce) links sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vodka</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove casing from sausage and add to the skillet. 
            Cook and stir until crumbly and brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until garlic is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes and salt; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cream and vodka; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and add pasta; toss for 1 minute. Stir in parsley; serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
